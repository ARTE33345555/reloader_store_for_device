 Reloaded Installer - minimal skeleton
====================================
This archive contains:
- android-client/: minimal Android project skeleton with ArtyomProtect components (Kotlin files)
- backend/: minimal Node.js backend skeleton (server.js)

To open Android project: import android-client as a Gradle project in Android Studio.
To run backend: npm install && node server.js

NOTE: This is a minimal skeleton for development. It intentionally avoids any code facilitating piracy
or bypassing official platform protections. For iOS or platform-specific deployment follow legal channels
(TestFlight, MDM), and for legacy Nokia/Symbian use archival tools and server-side analysis.
